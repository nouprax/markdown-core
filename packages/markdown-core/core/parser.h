     * identical tree, so the claim is asserted on these rather than on a dump.
     *
     * `finish_walk_events` is every iterator step the finish stage took: the
     * walk's own ENTER, EXIT and DONE events, plus the ENTER and EXIT that
     * consolidation advances over when it absorbs a following Text sibling
     * (those nodes are visited -- by consolidation, which completes and frees
     * them -- and counted as visited). Repositioning the cursor back to the
     * survivor's EXIT is not a step: that event was already delivered.
     * `finish_nodes_entered` is the ENTER events among them, absorbed siblings
     * included; `finish_walk_roots` is the DONE events, one per root walked.
     *
     * The denominator is taken without a traversal, at the two seams where
     * nodes come and go. `nodes_created` counts every node a parse makes, at
     * the same operation that records the node's kind, so the audit that
     * holds one holds the other; `nodes_freed` counts every node a parse
     * releases through `markdown_core_parser_release_node`, which the finish
     * stage's every free takes -- consolidation's, and each step's, which the
     * finish-hook audit holds -- and which counts the descendants and field
     * roots that go with a node, since the release loop visits each of them.
     * The walk notes both in `..._before_finish` as it starts. The finished
     * tree holds every node that existed when the walk started, plus those
     * the walk's inline parsing handed it (`finish_nodes_parsed`, which the
     * walk enters), less those the stage freed, plus those its steps made
     * (which it never enters), so one traversal per root is exactly
     *
     *   finish_nodes_entered == nodes in the finished tree
     *                           + (nodes_freed - nodes_freed_before_finish)
     *                           - (nodes_created - nodes_created_before_finish)
     *                           + finish_nodes_parsed
     *
     * where the finished tree is counted by whoever holds it (the api test
     * walks it with the public iterator and the owned-subtree visitors), and

     * count, would enter k times as many. `finish_walk_events == 2 *
     * finish_nodes_entered + finish_walk_roots` then says that every step
     * taken was one of those events. A whole-root consolidation driven through
     * the public entry point with a parser adds exactly one traversal of that
     * root to the events, the entered and the roots.
     *

/* THE PARSE'S NODE OPERATIONS, WHICH RECORD THE KIND THEY PRODUCE.
 *
 * `kinds_created` decides which finish hooks run -- a global pass, a step at
 * every event it was projected to -- so a production site that writes a kind
 * without recording it does not fail a build or a test: it makes the gate skip
 * a hook some document needed, and the defect surfaces
 * as a missing rewrite far from the line that caused it. That is a bad thing
 * to police with an audit over twenty-one call sites, so it is not policed:
 * recording is part of producing a node, in the two operations below.
 *
 * `markdown_core_node_new` and `markdown_core_node_set_kind` stay for callers
 * that have no parse -- the tests build trees by hand -- and production code
 * uses these instead, which `scripts/audit/check-parser-kind-record.mjs` holds.
 *
 * The record OVER-APPROXIMATES, deliberately. A node the parse creates and
 * then discards leaves its bit set although the finished tree holds no such
 * node. Making it exact would mean observing REMOVAL, and the only way to do
 * that is another walk of the whole tree -- which is the cost this record
 * exists to avoid. Over-approximating can only make the gate skip fewer
 * passes, never miss one, because a kind in the finished tree was necessarily
 * created; and a pass that runs over a tree holding none of its declared kinds
 * finds nothing to do. */
