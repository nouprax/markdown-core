# @nouprax/es-markdown-core

Immutable ECMAScript and TypeScript bindings for Markdown Core, backed by the
same C parser compiled to WebAssembly.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @nouprax/es-markdown-core
```

The package is ESM-only and supports Node.js 20 or later and browsers that can
load its WebAssembly asset. Importing the module completes WebAssembly
initialization, so `Document.parse` is synchronous.

## Parse Markdown

```js
import { Document, TreeDumper } from "@nouprax/es-markdown-core";

const document = Document.parse("# Hello", {
  directives: false,
});

console.log(document.content[0].kind);
console.log(document.dump());
console.log(TreeDumper.dump(document.content[0]));
```

All parse options default to `true`: smart punctuation, footnotes, HTML comment
stripping, tables, strikethrough, autolinks, task lists, formulas, dollar and
LaTeX formula delimiters, and directives. Pass only the options you want to
override.

`Document.parse` returns a discriminated `Markup` union with source scopes and
recursively readonly TypeScript properties. The JavaScript objects are not
runtime-frozen. The package exposes parsing and typed AST inspection, not
rendering or AST mutation.

## Traverse and Inspect

`visit(markup, visitor)` dispatches exactly one node to an exhaustive typed
`Visitor`. `walk(markup, walkingVisitor)` performs a stack-safe depth-first walk
and dispatches `entering` and `exiting` to an exhaustive `WalkingVisitor` by
node kind. Each node-kind branch chooses its typed fields and content; there is
no public iterator or uniform child projection. A directive label is walked as
the named `label` field, not as directive content.

`TreeDumper.dump(markup)` and each Markup's non-enumerable `dump()` method emit
the canonical debug tree for a complete document or focused subtree. The
text is intended for logs, snapshots, and debugging rather than persistence or
data interchange.
